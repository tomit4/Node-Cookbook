<h4>Let's Get Cooking!</h4>
These files are documenting the following of the tutorials covered in the Node Cookbook.  Throughout these files you will find a series of tutorials and their solutions, ranging from setting up a basic HTML server with raw JavaScript in NodeJS, to setting up an ExpressJS Server, explorations into the basics of APIs such as KoaJS and HappiJS, testing and security modules, along with many other tutorials.
####Installation:
In order to follow along with many of these tutorials, you will obviously need to download the most recent version of NodeJS and the Node Package Manager from either the official websites (*please note that the Node Package Manager comes preinstalled with NodeJS if downloaded from their official website*):

[Install NodeJS on Windows or Mac](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Or if you're using a Linux distribution, you may prefer to download NodeJS from your distribution's repositories:

<h5>Debian/Ubuntu Linux:<h5>

```sudo apt install nodejs```

```sudo apt install npm```

<h5>Arch Linux:</h5>

```sudo pacman -S nodejs```

```sudo pacman -S npm```

Depending on your particular distribution, you may need to look up further documentation on how to install NodeJS and the Node Package Manager.

<h4>Installing Dependencies:</h4>
Many of the directories within this repository already come with a package.json file which includes a list of all the packages necessary to run and test the application.  Once you have navigated to the directory you wish to test, simply input into your terminal:
<br>
<br>

```npm install```

<br>
This will automatically install all dependencies necessary to run and test the application.

*Please note that this repository is more for documentation purposes only. This repository simply documents my personal progress through the Node Cookbook's tutorials and is not meant to be used as a manual/tutorial.  If you do choose to utilize the Node Cookbook, please simply follow the tutorials on your own. I have also intentionally omitted certain sections like the sections that cover MongoDB, Reddis, Docker, and Kubernetes because I did not feel that they were related to my learning journey at this time (we'll get to those later).*
